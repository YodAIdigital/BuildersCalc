## Why This Exists
Enable a local builder in Cromwell/Queenstown to win enquiries for custom cabins. Prospects need a quick way to assess quality, options, and how to contact Zeke (021 180 1218).

## Problems It Solves
- Scattered information about offerings and process
- Unclear contact path or next steps
- Lack of trust signals (photos, testimonials)
- Friction on mobile navigation and form submission

## How It Should Work
- Single-page site with sticky top nav anchors to sections:
  - Hero, About, Gallery, Testimonials, FAQs, Contact
- Prominent actions:
  - “Get a quote” (scroll to contact)
  - “Call Zeke 021 180 1218” (tel link)
- Lightweight client-side validation; no backend dependency
- Warm, approachable design language aligned with Central Otago
