Notes
- All URLs are resolved using Viteâ€™s BASE_URL automatically in code; just keep the folder under tools/public.
- Prefer seamless, tileable images. Keep normal maps in linear color space.
- If multiple materials share the same source file initially, copy to the expected filename (simplifies code).

Licensing
- Include the source URL and license for each file here.
- AmbientCG assets are typically licensed under CC0 1.0.
